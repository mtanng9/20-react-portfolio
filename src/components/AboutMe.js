                <p>
                    As a Full Stack Developer with a background in Chemistry and Bioengineering, 
                    I bring a critical problem-solving approach, a drive for experimentation and learning, 
                    and an aptitude for building projects from the ground up. 
                    I have hands-on experience working with programming languages like React, JavaScript, 
                    and back-end technologies such as Node.js and SQL, which allows me to tackle challenging projects 
                    with creativity and resourcefulness. 
                    If you're interested in learning more about my experience and approach to software engineering, 
                    please don't hesitate to get in touch.
